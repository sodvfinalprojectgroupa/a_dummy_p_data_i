just replace the hosted api url for the generation site with one of this repository pages url's to fetch the json file data. 
if you made a new generated dataset then upload the file to this repo and update the pages site to be able to reference the files json content. 
link on index page is optional, just need the pages url + filename. IE 


url syntax:
    https://sodvfinalprojectgroupa.github.io/a_dummy_p_data_i/<folder name here>/<file name here>.json
